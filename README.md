# Spring Basics CI Using List

Constructor injection using list is a type of dependency injection in the Spring Framework where a list of objects is passed to a bean’s constructor. 
This is done by configuring a list in the Spring configuration file and then passing it to the bean’s constructor. 
This allows for a more flexible and dynamic configuration of beans, as the list can be changed without having to change the code of the bean. 
Constructor injection using list is a useful way of injecting dependencies into a bean, and can be used to inject any type of object, such as beans, collections.
